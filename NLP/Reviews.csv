Wow... Loved this place.,1
Crust is not good.,0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.,0
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation...,1
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices.,1
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.,0
Honestly it didn't taste THAT fresh.,0
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer.,0
The fries were great too.,1
A great touch.,1
Service was very prompt.,1
Would not go back.,0
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being way overpriced.,0
"I tried the Cape Cod ravoli, chicken,with cranberry...mmmm!",1
I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.,0
I was shocked because I found out the tuna salad had only 3 different types of lettuce in it...,0
Highly recommended.,1
Waitress was a little slow in service.,0
"This place is not worth your time, let alone Vegas.",0
did not like at all.,0
The Burritos Blah!,0
"The food, amazing.",1
Service is also cute.,1
I could care less... The interior was just done.,0
So they performed.,1
That's right... the red velvet cake!,1
They never brought a salad we asked for.,0
"This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.",1
"Took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm, our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed.",0
The worst was the salad it had wilted pieces of green and slimy tomato.,0
"Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal.",1
This was like the final blow!,0
